This site contains \r\nexamples of many different types of broken link, both in HTML and CSS style sections. In addition \r\nit tests whether a link-checking tool follows directives in the robots.txt file, telling the tool \r\nto ignore a link which would otherwise be reported as bad. There are 74 known bad links in \r\nDeadLinkCity.com, and one additional link which should not be reported if the tool obeys robots.txt \r\ndirectives.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe tools that were tested consisted of five online checkers and three downloadable programs.\r\n<B>The perfect score is 74</B> - the closer the number of reported errors is to 74, the more accurate the tool is.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<TABLE border=\"1\" bordercolor=\"#C0C0C0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n<TR><TH></TH><TH>Tool</TH><TH>Format</TH><TH>Errors reported</TH><TH>Obeys robots.txt?</TH><TH>Notes</TH></TR>\r\n<TR><TD><B>1</B></TD><TD>DeadLinkChecker.com</TD><TD>Online</TD><TD><B>74</B></TD><TD>Yes</TD><TD>Perfect Score</TD></TR>\r\n<TR><TD>2</TD><TD>Web Link Validator</TD><TD>Download</TD><TD><B>60</B></TD><TD>No</TD><TD></TD></TR>\r\n<TR><TD>3</TD><TD>Xenu Link Sleuth</TD><TD>Download</TD><TD><B>57</B></TD><TD>No</TD><TD></TD></TR>\r\n<TR><TD>4</TD><TD>LinkTiger.com</TD><TD>Online</TD><TD><B>45</B></TD><TD>Unknown</TD><TD>Requires Credit Card</TD></TR>\r\n<TR><TD>5</TD><TD>SEMRush.com</TD><TD>Online</TD><TD><B>43</B></TD><TD>No</TD><TD></TD></TR>\r\n<TR><TD>6</TD><TD>DrLinkChecker.com</TD><TD>Online</TD><TD><B>39</B></TD><TD>No</TD><TD></TD></TR>\r\n<TR><TD>7</TD><TD>BrokenLinkCheck.com</TD><TD>Online</TD><TD><B>15</B></TD><TD>No</TD><TD></TD></TR>\r\n<TR><TD>8</TD><TD>PowerMapper.com</TD><TD>Online</TD><TD><B>9</B></TD><TD>Unknown</TD><TD></TD></TR>\r\n<TR><TD>9</TD><TD>Screaming Frog</TD><TD>Download</TD><TD><B>Unknown</B></TD><TD>Unknown</TD><TD>Requires Java</TD></TR>\r\n\r\n</TABLE>\r\n\r\n<H3>Detailed results</H3>\r\n\r\n<B>DeadLinkChecker.com</B>\r\n<p>\r\nA free online tool, with an optional autochecker subscription for automatic checking\r\nof up to 100 websites with up to 1,000,000 links.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis tool located all 74 links in the test site, and was the only one of the tested tools to respect\r\nthe robots.txt directive. The error report showed the HTML error code for each invalid link together\r\nwith the URLs of the link and the page containing it, and any associated text to assist in locating\r\nthe link within the HTML source.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis appears to be the most accurate and thorough link checking tool on the market today.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<B>SEMRush.com - site audit</B>\r\n<p>\r\nSEMRush requires free registration, using an email address to confirm your identity, before use. Once\r\nregistered you can click the button 'Create my first project', choosing project domain www.deadlinkcity.com\r\nand project name DeadLinkCity.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe dashboard shows various tools - site audit, position tracking, SEO ideas and social media tool.\r\nLink checking is part of the site audit.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe comprehensive configuration options in Site Audit allow you to control the scan - you can:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Limit the number of checked pages, </li>\r\n<li>Specify a particular subdomain, </li>\r\n<li>Determine the user-agent to be used, </li>\r\n<li>Set the crawl-delay (default 1 second between pages, but can respect robots.txt crawl-delay), </li>\r\n<li>Set URL filters for pages to specifically exclude or include, </li>\r\n<li>Specify URL query parameters to remove before checking a URL, </li>\r\n<li>Set the scan time/frequency (day of week, or once only).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen the scan is set up, click 'start audit'. The report gave DeadLinkCity.com a 50% health score,\r\nclaiming to have scanned 102 pages (links) of which 52 had issues, 41 were broken, 4 were redirects\r\nand 5 were healthy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nGetting to the actual errors involves drilling into various sections of the report, and could be made\r\nmore intuitive.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe tool found all the 4xx and 5xx HTML status errors and missing images, but failed to find bad links\r\nwithin CSS style, or within any HTML elements other than &lt;IMG&gt; and &lt;A&gt; tags. It did not\r\nappear to respect the 'allowed' directive in robots.txt\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<B>DrLinkCheck.com</B>\r\n<p>\r\nTo use this free online link checker, enter the URL to check and click 'Start'. The scan runs\r\nquickly, showing a list of good and bad links with 12 to a page.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe summary showed 50 links checked - 49 internal and 1 external - with 46 broken links detected. For\r\neach link there was a tick or a cross to indicate whether it was broken or not, together with the URL\r\nof th elink and the page it was found in. Hovering the mouse over a broken link indicated the HTML\r\nstatus code (404, 500, etc.)\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis tool found all 4xx/5xx errors, but missed bad CSS links and most bad HTML links in elements other\r\nthan &lt;A&gt; tags. It ignored the robots.txt directive.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<B>BrokenLinkCheck.com</B>\r\n<p>\r\nThis free online tool offers checking of up to 3000 pages, with no limits on the number of links within\r\nthose pages. To check larger sites, you are asked to contact the authors for a quote.\r\n</p><p>\r\nScanning is simply a matter of enter the URL to check (www.deadlinkcity.com) - you are then asked to\r\nfill in a captcha, and are given the option to show distinct broken links only, or all occurrences of\r\neach broken link. Clicking on 'Find broken links now' starts the scan.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe report showed the URL of each bad link, its HTML status code, and the URL of the page containing\r\nthe link. It also linked to a source-code view highlighting the line containg the bad link.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHowever only 17 bad links were reported - the tool failed to spot links with an HTML error code above\r\n414, missing images, redirections, or errors in CSS or HTML elements other than &lt;A&gt; tags.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<B>PowerMapper.com - SortSite</B>\r\n<p>\r\nPowerMapper SortSite is a downloadable application with a free online trial version that can scan 10\r\npages of any public website.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEntering www.deadlinkcity.com and pressing 'test site' ran the scan, which said there were 18% pages\r\nwith issues. The online report was a tabbed display whose navigation was not immediately obvious - however\r\nthere was quite a lot of information available in addition to the bad links, including advice on usability,\r\ncompatibility, privacy and standards compliance.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe bad link information was rather sparse - only 9 bad links were reported (those with HTML status\r\ncodes betwen 400 and 407). Perhaps this was a result of using the free tool. Each link showed the URLs\r\nof the bad link and the page it was referenced. A line-number linked out to an HTML source view of the\r\npage with all errors and warnings interspersed within the HTML.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<B>LinkTiger.com</B>\r\n<p>\r\nLink Tiger is a paid service with a free trial. After entering the URL to check, an account has to be\r\nset up using an email address and password. The scan then started, and shortly afterwards an email arrived\r\nsaying:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\"Your website(s) currently have 57 links, with 45 broken links (broken link report will be accessible\r\nin the next step). \r\nWe pre-selected the Large subscription based on the amount of links. \r\nPlease visit LinkTiger Signup and fill in your credit card information to activate your 15 Day Free\r\nTrial. Your credit card will not be billed and you can cancel anytime. \"\r\n</p><p>\r\nWe were not prepared to hand over credit card details at this stage, so it is unclear which dead links\r\nwere identified by Link Tiger - however it seems to have missed many of them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<B>Xenu Link Sleuth</B>\r\n<p>\r\nXenu Link Sleuth has been around for some time, and is rather quirky but quite effective. It is a\r\ndownloadable program which needs to be installed on a WIndows PC. It does not run on Mac or any OS\r\nother than Windows.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn starting Xenu Link Sleuth, select the File->Check URL menu option and enter the URL in the dialog\r\nthat appears. There are options to list URL patterns to include or exclude from the scan, and the 'more\r\noptions' button allows you to fine-tune the data that will be presented in the final report, as well as\r\na few scanning parameters. Clicking 'OK@ then starts the scan.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe scan is very fast. When it finishes, there is a box asking for FTP details - this would be used\r\nto check for 'orphan' files on the server which are not linked in the HTML, but this feature is not\r\nneeded so the box can be cancelled. A browser window is then opened with the report.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe report itself contains a list of valid links, suitable for making a sitemap, and the broken links\r\norganised first alphabetically, and then by the page they are found on.\r\n</p><p>\r\nXenu Link Sleuth identified 57 bad links on DeadLinkCity.com - it failed to spot missing images in\r\nCSS, and certain HTML elements went unchecked (including audio, video and some form data). It did not\r\nrespect the directive in the robots.txt file.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<B>Web Link Validator (RelSoftware)</B>\r\n<p>\r\nWebLinkValidator is a downloadable application with a 30-day trial period. It appears to be WIndows\r\nonly. The trial version is limited to 500 links.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe QuickStart menu option allows you to enter a URL to be scanned. There are options to restrict\r\nthe scan to one page, to check external links, and to run a spell checker. The scan ran fairly quickly,\r\nand reported 76 links checked, 75 verified, 12 good, 63 bad.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe tool spotted all 4xx and 5xx errors. It missed just a handful of non-&lt;A&gt; HTML errors. It\r\nsuccessfully spotted missing images within CSS.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<B>Screaming Frog</B>\r\n<p>\r\nThis standalone program requires Java to run. Java is a well-known security risk so the tool was not tested.\r\n</p>\r\n&nbsp;<BR>\r\n<B>Note:</B>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the interest of total transparency, we disclose that these reviews, Dead Link City and Dead Link Checker\r\nare all authored by DLC Websites.
